# Scenario Outline: Dummy Player Discard Behaviour
#    Given Dummy Player's hand is "ğŸ€š"
#    And is Dummy Player's turn
#    And Dummy Player picked "<picked tile>"
#    When Dummy Player discards a tile
#    Then the discarded tile is "<discarded tile>"

#    Examples:
#    | picked tile | discarded tile |
#    | ğŸ€›           | ğŸ€›             |
#    | ğŸ€š           | ğŸ€š             |
