        Given I have joined a game
        And I am level "1" player
        And I start a game

    Scenario: Starting a game hosted by player
        Then I should see that I have "4" tiles
        And I have nothing picked
        When I pick
        Then I've got one tile picked

    Scenario: Testability for player
        Given the next tile to be picked is "ðŸ€¡"
        When I pick
        Then I should see my new pick is "ðŸ€¡"

        Given I pick
        And the next tile to be picked is "ðŸ€¡"
        When I discard my new pick
        Then I should see my opponent picks up tile "ðŸ€¡"
